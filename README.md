# Godot Commit Artifacts

This project is provided for Godot Engine users and contributors to
easily and reliably get links to the CI build artifacts for the main
development branches. While these artifacts are not suitable for
production use, they can be used for testing and early feature
adoption.

## Contributing

This project is written in JavaScript and is built using Node.JS. HTML and CSS are
used for the presentation. The end result of the build process is completely static
and can be server from any web server, no Node.JS required.

Front-end is designed in a reactive manner using industry standard Web Components
(powered by `lit-element`). This provides native browser support, and results in a
small overhead from the build process.

To build the project locally you need to have Node.JS installed (12.x and newer
should work just fine).

This project uses GitHub's GraphQL API. To fetch live data you need to generate
a [personal OAuth token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
You can supply your token to the scripts using the `GRAPHQL_TOKEN` environment
variable. Note, that if you don't have member access to the organization, you
may not be able to access all the information used when generating the database.

1. Clone or download the project.
2. From the project root run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` or `yarn run build` to build the pages.
4. Run `npm run compose-db` or `yarn run compose-db` to fetch the data from GitHub.
5. Serve the `out/` folder with your method of choice (e.g. using Python 3:
   `python -m http.server 8080 -d ./out`).

`rollup` is used for browser packing of scripts and copying of static assets. The
data fetching script is plain JavaScript with `node-fetch` used to polyfill
`fetch()`-like API.
